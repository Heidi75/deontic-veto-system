HPLM Payment Audit Engine
Executive Summary
This repository implements a Hybrid Pyramid Logic Model (HPLM) for cross-border fintech verification. Unlike standard AI models that prioritize "narrative fluency," this system utilizes a 7-layer engineering stack to ensure "physical truth" and regulatory compliance.
Key Architecture Layers
* Layer 1: Neural Intake: Ingests unstructured financial reports and payment narratives. * Layer 4: Symbolic Arena: Performs computational verification and dimensional analysis of transaction variables. * Layer 5: Deontic Veto Gate: A hard-stop mechanism that issues an absolute refusal if a logical contradiction or policy violation is detected.
* Layer 6: Traceback & Audit (TAL): Provides a 100% transparent logic-path map for forensic auditing of every decision.





Deployment
Verified outputs are only reached at the Action & Deployment Layer (Layer 7), ensuring a "Safe Harbor" for real-world financial trades.
